        <h1>Heart-pounding performance is in its DNA</h1>
        <p>Brute power and a traditionally unassuming design make the S8 Plus a veritable wolf in sheep’s clothing. The “Plus” means the twin-turbo V-8 now makes 605 hp—85 hp more than before—while a rear-biased all-wheel-drive system makes sure all that power is applied to the pavement in a controlled and civilized manner. The interior is sumptuous and loaded with tech. Despite its conservative styling and perceived sedate luxury car status, the S8 Plus can keep up with nearly anything on the road.</p>

    <h1>AMG: Driving performance for 50 years</h1>
        <p>In an old mill in 1967, two automotive engineers with a passion for motorsports began turning Mercedes-Benz sedans into winning racecars. Today, as the performance division of Mercedes-Benz, AMG continues to create victory on the track and desire on the streets of the world. Every Mercedes-AMG vehicle is the product of craftsmen, designers and engineers who live to test limits, and for a singular goal: Driving Performance.</p>

    <h1>M</h1><h2>THE MOST POWERFUL LETTER IN THE WORLD</h2>

But don’t just take our word for it. Grip the wheel of any of our eight M models—from coupes to convertibles to Sports Activity Vehicles® – and elevate your adrenaline rushes to a whole new level.</p>
